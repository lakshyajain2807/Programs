// error is non recoverable in java, program cant handle an error.
// exception is somthing that prevents the normal flow of the program - like I/O or somthing.
// In Java, there's a class called "throwable" which is the parent class of all exceptions and errors.

// Exceptions ---> category ----> Error
// Checked || Unchecked Exceptions

// Checked Exceptions: 1) Happens at compile time
// 2) for ex- try to open an file which does not exist.
// 3) for this, we use tyr-catch block, to try all the things, and if something bad happens, we catch is there.
// 4) In the divide method, we used inbuilt "Arithmatic Exception"
// 5) These exceptions are not defaulted by the compiler, for ex- arithmatic, normal exceptions, etc. But the more strictly ones have to be called at the top and not at the bottom.
// 6) created, the myException file, and using it here, my Exception considers calls the super that itself calls the main constructor.
