// Working of arraylist behind the sscens
// >> arr when you declared it is created in the stack and objects pointing towards the values as reference in the heap
// >>Size is actually fixed> now, when you fill the array to its capacity > a new arraylist is created with double the capacity and old elements copied to that > old one now is empty and gets destroyed
