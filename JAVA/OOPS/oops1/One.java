        // >> to see something instead of null , we use new keyword which dynamically allocates memory at run time and returns a reference variable to it.
        // Student student1 = new Student(); , on LHS 0 it is happening at the compile time(code is exceuting, errors are shown, source code conversion to byte code) , on the RHS it is happening at compile time, means after code verification by jvm it is actuslly running and now the memory is being allocated.
        //  Now, when i do s1.name,s1.roll => it checks weather i have assigned a value and if not it prints the default value instead.
        // Now, one thing is for sure, there should be a way where all the properties can be assigned in a single line, here laksh.name , laksh.roll, laksh.email,...100 properties i have to write so much
