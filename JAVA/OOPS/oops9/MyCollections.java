    //Also draw the diagram of the flowchart
    //collections are alreaddy present in the java.util package
    // Simply  aise smjho- ArrayList, StringBuilder etc, mei jo add, remove, edit ke methods hote hai woh common hote hai , so java was like - let me put all the common things inside an interface.
    //For ex- List extends the Collection >> simply means the methodds in the list are also contained in the Collections , so to utlize them  
    //  see list.add or list2.add > both have common methods , thats the beauty 
    // Now, ArrayList and Vector what is the key difference between both of them >> in arraylist, multiple threads in the java can access the array object easily,  but in the case of the vector, if one thread has the access , the second one has to wait in line to finish the
