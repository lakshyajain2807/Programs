/* 1. EAGER Initialization Singleton
✅ Theory
In eager initialization, the singleton instance is created as soon as the class is loaded, even if it’s never used.

✅ Key Characteristics
Instance is created at class loading time.

Thread-safe because the class loader mechanism ensures that the instance is created before any thread accesses it.

Fast and simple implementation.

✅ When to Use
When the singleton is always needed.

When instance creation is not resource-intensive.

✅ Drawbacks
If the instance is never used, it results in memory waste.

🔷 2. LAZY Initialization Singleton
✅ Theory
In lazy initialization, the instance is created only when it’s needed for the first time.

✅ Key Characteristics
Saves memory by delaying object creation.

Not thread-safe by default — if two threads call getInstance() simultaneously, two objects could be created.

✅ When to Use
When you want to delay the object creation until it’s absolutely required.

In single-threaded applications.

✅ Drawbacks
Must be manually made thread-safe for use in multi-threaded environments.

🔷 3. Thread-Safe Singleton (Double-Checked Locking)
✅ Theory
This version uses lazy initialization with thread-safety by applying synchronization and double-checking before creating the instance.

✅ Key Characteristics
Solves the problem of multiple threads creating separate instances.

Uses synchronized and double-checked locking (check before and after acquiring lock).

volatile keyword ensures that the object is fully initialized before other threads see it.

✅ When to Use
In multi-threaded applications where performance matters.

When you want lazy initialization + thread safety.

✅ Drawbacks
Slightly more complex than other approaches.

🔷 4. Enum Singleton
✅ Theory
Java allows a singleton to be implemented using an enum, where the enum itself ensures a single instance is maintained.

✅ Key Characteristics
Simplest and safest way to implement a singleton.

Implicitly thread-safe.

Protects against serialization, reflection, and cloning issues.

✅ When to Use
In modern Java applications where you need a robust, minimal singleton.

When you don’t need lazy initialization but need full safety and simplicity.

✅ Drawbacks
Enum singleton is eagerly initialized by default.

Some developers may find it less intuitive for more complex singleton behavior.
